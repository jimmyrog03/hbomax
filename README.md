# Hbomax

This project contains a clone of the popular streaming site HBOMax, built from the ground up for my Intro to Software Engineering lab at West Virginia University. Most of the functionality of the site does not exist, but page design and navigation was accomplished using custom css and html files and attempted to look as authentic as the original site at the time of the course. 

Page navigation also only exists for categories in the left hand menu, not including movie genres, as well as the search button and **HBOMax** header logo.

I've provided the following instructions to launch the site yourself using Ubuntu Linux, as this was the environment used to build and run the project. The version of Ubuntu used during development was 20.04, and as of recent testing on another VM running Ubuntu 20.04, this method should still work.

## Setup
- Open terminal in Ubuntu
- Clone repository to location of your choice and cd into project location.
````
git clone https://github.com/jimmyrog03/hbomax.git
cd hbomax
````
- Install dependencies for the project
````
sudo apt update
sudo apt install npm
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@13.1.2
````
- Need to also install currect NodeJS version, the following instructions were found online at this [Node.js Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04)
> The following code was used from the tutorial, but it was recommended to execute the curl statement without `| bash` to ensure the location was correct. See link above for more in depth instructions.
````
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install v17.3.1
````
> To check if using the correct version, enter `node -v`.

> If version does not match v17.3.1, type `nvm use v17.3.1`
- While in project location, type `ng serve` which should begin to run generating the application on a localhost. Once it has successfully generated it will display a message similar to:
````
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
````
- Right click the link prompted in the terminal and **Open Link**.
- The site should then bring you to the login page, but can be bypassed by clicking the menu in the top left and choosing a category at the top of the list.
> Actual login and security checks were not required for the project so were not fully implemented.

# The following portion of ReadMe was autogenerated by Angular CLI on initial project creation.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
